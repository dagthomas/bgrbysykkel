## Why BGR Bysykkel?

Oslo Bysykkel gives users the opportunity to rent bikes on a daily, or monthy basis.<br> 
This project was made to show info about the close, surrounding stations to our offices <br>
In order the make traveling more effective.<br>

Since oslobysykkel.no API does not allow CORS - I download the .json data via CURL.<br>

 * Show all locations, with ID
 * Show default view of stations surrounding our offices
 * Show view based on user input
 <br>
